Configuration tested on Thinkpad W530 and, with small changes, on Microsoft Surface 4 PRO with Fedora Linux.
  
On Surface Pro 4 there are some problems with scaling on software based on Chromium, like Google Chrome, Brave Browser, Vivaldi and so on.  
Otherwise for other needs it's sufficient to act on the SCALE variable and set it as desired.
